### Caracal is a library and platform for managing a decentralized, BitTorrent-based social network.

### This project is still majorly under constuction, but I'm making it public for posterity's sake.

### Users should be able to...
- Post
- Pack post into an encrypted file, and post magnet link to repo.
- View posts, aggregating saved posts and checking for/downloading new ones.
- Add friends by exchanging keys.
